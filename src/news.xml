<h2>Dana White Likely Retiring Featherweight With Amanda Nunes</h2><p>In the end, Amanda Nunes would completely dominate Irene Aldana, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/results/ufc-289-amanda-nunes-vs-irene-aldana-results-highlights">en route to a unanimous decision </a>and defending the bantamweight title. Following the victory, she announced that she was retiring from the sport on top, while still holding belts at 135lb and 145lb.</p><p>Speaking to media after the event, UFC President Dana White said that he was not surprised to see Nunes walk away at this point, given the success she has had. Moreover, when asked about the future of the virtually non-existent featherweight division, he all-but confirmed that the division would retire with Amanda.</p><p>"I'm not shocked that she retired. I've been saying for awhile, she's made a lot of money and her life is a lot different than it was 10 years ago," White said (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbronsteter/status/1667767641459818496?t=HWPHLlU0gPy9TAK9yHoDIw&amp;s=19">Aaron Bronsteter.</a>&nbsp;"Would I like to see her stick around and do some more?

<p>It is not entirely surprising to hear Dana White say that the women's fratherweight division will probably be dissolved with Amanda Nunes retiring, given the fact that across five years and three champions, there has <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/features/wild-world-of-fighting-ngannou-featherweight">never been a list of rankings for the division. </a>It will be interesting to see if the UFC decides to replace it with another division in women's MMA; perhaps one with more established talent.</p><ul><li><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/amanda-nunes-ufc-289-retirement-reaction">'I Scared You Into Retirement' - Julianna Pena, Gilbert Burns, Aljamain Sterling &amp; Others React To Amanda Nunes' Dominant UFC 289 Win &amp; Retirement</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTgyODQ2NjMyMjQwNTc5/dana-white-amanda-nunes-retirement.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bantamweight Contender Sets Up Fight For Vacant Title After Amanda Nunes' Retirement At UFC 289]]></title><description><![CDATA[Following Amanda Nunes retirement at UFC 289, Raquel Pennington suggested the UFC should book a matchup for the vacant women’s bantamweight title featuring her and Julianna Peña.

He began his amateur career&nbsp;at Sparta Combat League, defeating Julian Colon by knockout in the first round on Nov. 2, 2019. After earning two more knockout wins in the amateurs, Colgan felt ready to be a professional fighter. He made his pro debut for Legacy Fighting Alliance against Andrew Claborn on March 19, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Shaking off the nerves in the middle of his debut, he finished Claborn by knockout in the third round. "King's" first pro win pushed him to continue to try to finish any opponent he would face. Two years later, Colgan is undefeated with seven wins, five by knockout and one by submission. He made his way to Bellator in 2021 and quickly achieved ranked status in the lightweight division.&nbsp;</p><p>At Bellator 297 on June 18, Colgan will face his most formidable challenge when he faces Emmanuel Sanchez.&nbsp;</p><p>Colgan shared with MMA News that he wants to be the second man to finish Sanchez in his career and make a huge statement. </p><p>Here's the video of our discussion, followed by written highlights.&nbsp;</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9N1lCcOL3M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Archie Colgan On Wanting To Finish Emmanuel Sanchez</h2><p>Sanchez has been with Bellator since 2014 and is a real test for Colgan. The Bellator veteran has a successful career in the company and has fought for a title at featherweight and lightweight. However, he is on a four-fight losing streak and also suffered his first loss by submission against&nbsp;Patrício "Pitbull" Freire at Bellator 209 on April 2, 2021. While Colgan wants to get a win over the former title challenger, he also wants to be on the shortlist that can say they've finished Sanchez in MMA.&nbsp;</p><p>"...I think this win over Emmanuel Sanchez coming up is going to be just a solid win to show that, yeah, I am that guy. I am here. He's not just beating guys who are his level or lower, like, yeah, he's able to finish the guys that were world title challengers. He's able to finish guys that, you know, haven't been finished. I think Emmanuel Sanchez has only been finished one time by guillotine by&nbsp;Patrício Pitbull, who is one of the greatest of all time in MMA.

<h2>Positive - Flyweight Continues To Strengthen</h2><p>Well, how about that for making an impact on debut?</p><p>In the space of 15 minutes at UFC 289, Stephen Erceg went from Australia's relatively unknown leading flyweight prospect to a top 10 fighter on MMA's biggest stage.</p><p>Just weeks before crossing the world to debut in Canada, "AstroBoy" was still awaiting his first opportunity inside the Octagon. Thanks to Matt Schnell's late withdrawal, that came on short notice against #10-ranked contender&nbsp;David Dvořák.</p><p>After showing that he certainly belongs in the UFC throughout a close opening round, Erceg shone in the second, dropping his Czech counterpart with a head kick and seemingly coming close to a guillotine finish on the ground.</p><p><em>*A brief side note, round two in this contest marked a good demonstration of an often misunderstood element of the judging criteria. While Dvořák controlled the majority of the round on the feet with consistent lands, the criteria is firm in that "immediate" weighs more heavily than "cumulative" offense. In that regard, the impact of Erceg's strikes and near-finishes comfortably put his efforts above his opponent's.*</em></p><p>Following a another strong frame, the Australian newcomer did enough to earn the nod on all three scorecards. And in an already consistently entertaining flyweight division, the addition and impressive debut of a top prospect (and now contender) was a big positive.</p><p>This fight also marked the second consecutive event where a late-notice debutant has impressed against a top 10 foe, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/video-dana-white-promises-to-give-debutant-his-win-money-despite-valiant-losing-effort-at-ufc-288">with Diego Lopes giving Movsar Evloev as much as he could handle at UFC 288</a>&nbsp;last month.</p><p>Underdogs rising to the occasion in their first Octagon outings on the PPV stage is certainly a trend I can get behind.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">✅ Fought on eight days notice<br>✅ Beat a top-10 flyweight in his UFC debut<br><br>STEVE ERCEG HAS ARRIVED 👏 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> <a href="https://t.co/1b1hxpFZh0">pic.twitter.com/1b1hxpFZh0</a></p>&mdash; ESPN MMA (@espnmma) <a href="https://twitter.com/espnmma/status/1667685297247715328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>

<h2>Positive - A Highlight For Canada</h2><p>Okay, I'm going to grit my teeth and hope to get through this entry without a reference to Ariel Helwani...</p><p>After a number of entertaining decisions at UFC 289, one of the host country's own turned the heat up with a highlight reel knockout in front of his home crowd. That fighter was Aiemann Zahabi, who lit up Rogers Arena during the preliminary card.</p><p>The Quebec native has always been known as a patient and composed fighter, something that can't be said for his opponent on Saturday, Aoriqileng. The "Mongolian Murderer" has a penchant for bursting out the gates and setting a relentless pace.</p><p>The question on fight night was who would impose their game best?</p><p>Well, as it turned out, the answer was Zahabi imposing Aoriqileng's...</p><p>After threatening with an early burst, the 35-year-old Canadian repeated the somewhat surprising act of aggression to close the show after just 64 seconds. <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/ufc-289-fighter-doesnt-realize-bout-is-over">The damage came from a brutal left hook</a>, with a few subsequent ground-and-pound strikes confirming the stoppage.</p><p>There's nothing like a knockout from a home favorite to get the crowd going, and Zahabi was responsible for just that at UFC 289.</p><p>We can no doubt look forward to hearing about the finish when he hosts <em>The MMA Hour</em> on Monday (damnit, I was so close...).</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AIEMANN ZAHABI WITH THE FIRST KNOCKOUT OF THE NIGHT!! 👊🇨🇦 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> <a href="https://t.co/Gc6l54aGg8">pic.twitter.com/Gc6l54aGg8</a></p>&mdash; UFC (@ufc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1667695036278947842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>

<h2>Negative - A Tough Break</h2><p>And everything was going so well...</p><p>Up until the featured contest, the UFC 289 prelims had delivered a thoroughly entertaining set of matchups. Unfortunately, the most anticipated contest on that portion of the card didn't get to follow suit.</p><p>The middleweight clash between Nassourdine Imavov and Chris Curtis was one of few pairings with ranking implications in Vancouver on Saturday. Ultimately, neither man was able to enhance their standing on the 185-pound ladder after an accidental clash of heads <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/chris-curtis-update-ufc-289-sean-strickland">rendered "The Action Man" unable to continue</a>.</p><p>This was a negative for all parties, from the two fighters to the fans in attendance. It's hard to describe how much of a tough break this was for Curtis, in particular,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/chris-curtis-to-appeal-controversial-loss-after-kelvin-gastelum-climbs-the-rankings-following-ufc-287-barnburner">who has now come off worse from headbutts in two consecutive bouts</a>.&nbsp;For Imavov, meanwhile, he saw his trek across the Atlantic and strong start inside the Octagon go to waste owing to an inadvertent incident.</p><p>After such a good start to the event, the disappointing end to the featured prelim certainly stalled the momentum heading into the PPV card.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chris Curtis was pleading for the fight to continue.

<h2>Negative - Too Close For Comfort</h2><p>When I envisioned possible negatives that could come from UFC 289, a host of fans falling out the stand during a walkout probably wouldn't have cracked the 100 most likely...</p><p>Somehow, someway, that actually happened.</p><p>When Canada's Mike Malott began his walkout, a group of fans clamoring for a high five got closer to their man than they'd have hoped for — a sentiment that can also be applied in regards to the concrete floor.</p><p>In all seriousness, this was nasty, and the fact that no one was left seriously injured was massively fortunate. Understandably, some questions will no doubt be directed at the venue. After all, spectators leaning on the railings during a fighter's walkout is hardly unexpected.</p><p>Initially, the incident even appeared serious enough for a potential pause in the action — is it smart to have a fight begin while medical personnel may be required in the crowd? Daniel Cormier's jovial reaction and giggle upon hearing of the moment also seemed questionable.</p><p>Thankfully, I'm not writing about severe injuries, but nonetheless, such an incident isn't nice to see. It also took away from the early goings of Malott and Adam Fugitt's fight as most were left concerned for those vaulted from the stand.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This could have been disastrous <a href="https://t.co/Z4oZsVvIXZ">pic.twitter.com/Z4oZsVvIXZ</a></p>&mdash; Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) <a href="https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1667747688530563072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>

<h2>Positive - A "Proper" Showing</h2><p>While Malott's appearance on home soil began with concern owing to the walkout incident, it ended in jubilation for him and his fellow Canadians.</p><p>In addition to ensuring that his nation's fighters went a perfect 5-0 on the night in Vancouver, "Proper" maintained his 100 percent finishing rate inside the Octagon with a third consecutive triumph.</p><p>After recording a memorable submission of Yohan Lainesse earlier this year, Malott put his grappling talents back on display at UFC 289, a skillset that he also used in his contract-winning performance on <em>Dana White's Contender Series</em>.</p><p>Having dropped Fugitt with a brutal combination on the feet, Malott locked in a tight guillotine choke for the tap.</p><p>Suffice to say, the Canadian's latest victory has firmly cemented him as the latest promising prospect at 170 pounds, and a significant number of eyeballs will certainly be on him when he makes the walk again.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mike Mallot looked phenomenal tonight!

<h2>Positive - "Do Bronx"</h2><p>I really thought that a Charles Oliveira win would be a negative, purely in the context of how it leaves the lightweight division.</p><p>In the end, "Do Bronx" delivered a memorable bounce-back performance, and I just can't put it down as anything but a positive.</p><p>On paper, like many, I've long seen Beneil Dariush as one of the biggest threats to Islam Makhachev, That, combined with a limited interest in seeing Oliveira and the Russian champion run it back, left me seeing a win and guaranteed first title shot for the Iranian-born American as the desired outcome.</p><p>But a vintage display from Oliveira? Yeah, that's not bad either.</p><p>Following a competitive period on the ground, the Brazilian closed the show on the feet before the end of the opening frame. After flooring Dariush with an overhand right behind the ear, "Do Bronx" forced Jason Herzog to step in with some vicious ground-and-pound strikes.</p><p>One thing I didn't expect to come from UFC 289 was a strong interest in Makhachev vs. Oliveira 2. Well, consider me intrigued. And <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/islam-makhachev-coach-assesses-title-implications-charles-oliveira-beneil-dariush">if the alternate is either Dustin Poirier or Justin Gaethje</a>, consider me firmly behind the former champ.</p><p>Oh, and if it needs saying, Oliveira is a star — his post-fight interview proved that and then some.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not going anywhere. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZfkMbhzIBJ">pic.twitter.com/ZfkMbhzIBJ</a></p>&mdash; UFC (@ufc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1667746791377469440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>

<h2>Negative - Disappointingly Uncompetitive&nbsp;</h2><p>I really thought Irene Aldana had a shot at dethroning Amanda Nunes. If not victorious, I thought she'd make it a somewhat close affair in defeat, and at the very least attempt to do so.</p><p>In the, however, Aldana's performance was far from competitive in the UFC 289 main event. Across the entirety of 25 minutes, the Mexican held a high guard — oh, how I wish that wasn't the end of the sentence.</p><p>The gun-shy Aldana was effectively battered on the feet, a scenario that seemed unlikely ahead of time owing to her skilful boxing ability. Despite her credentials, though, "Robles" did nothing to earn the respect of the champion, and nothing that resembled a motivated title challenger pursuing championship glory.</p><p>The Guadalajara-based fighter essentially performed similar to Yoel Romero against Israel Adesanya in 2020. Unlike "The Last Stylebender," however, Nunes didn't match that lack of output and instead teed off, treating Aldana like a punching bag.</p><p>For what had been an entertaining main card, the main event wasn't the conclusion anyone would have hoped for. Although I was fairly pleased to see Nunes' trilogy with Julianna Peña collapse and Aldana get the shot instead, at least "The Venezuelan Vixen" would have left it all in there.</p><p>In the aftermath, Nunes announced her retirement. On one hand, it seems like a slightly underwhelming fight to leave the sport on the back of. But on the other, another show of utter dominance is perhaps the appropriate way for the women's GOAT to depart.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Lioness DOMINATES all 5 rounds in this one 🦁 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> <a href="https://t.co/7dEyFi5C3v">pic.twitter.com/7dEyFi5C3v</a></p>&mdash; UFC (@ufc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1667758300954349571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>

Canadians are tough," he quipped.</p><p>In the end, this was a breakout performance from Mike Malott, who appears to have the full momentum of the UFC promotional machine behind him.

                    <p>“Zabit [Magomedsharipov] was one,” Adeanya answered. “He’s retired now…That was the first one that jumped to my head. Ciryl Gane – f***ing love the way he moves, I love the striking. But it’s not just about being effective. There’s a lot of people that are effective, but this is mixed martial arts. Martial arts. Arts. I like something that when I watch it, it makes me feel a way. Like ‘Wow, I’m amazed.’ Like it makes me – evokes some kind of emotion out of me. So when I watch guys like Ciryl Gane…Yair [Rodriguez] is another one, his last fight I was really impressed by the way he was moving and stuff…Ian Garry. Yeah, cause f***. Song Kenan, that combo he finished him off with, beautiful.”
</p><p>Gane’s striking skills carried him to a 10-0 record and the UFC’s interim heavyweight title before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/ciryl-gane-september-return-sergei-pavlovich">coming up short</a> in his bids to become the outright champion against Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones.

He was wearing a belt the whole time.</p><h2>The King of Pop(ping a Jab)</h2><p>It has been said, especially in the boxing side of the Wild World of Fighting, that having proper footwork and movement in a fight is akin to dancing. Using that logic, had he applied himself, it is possible that Michael Jackson could have become the greatest defensive boxer of his era.</p><p>Luckily, you need not use only your imagination to picture what that would have looked like. A viral video shows what the King of Pop might have done, had he focused on the sweet science.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m so done 💀😂💀😂💀😂💀😂💀😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/HruUf9G7HZ">pic.twitter.com/HruUf9G7HZ</a></p>&mdash; justasisterfromthechi (@justasisterfro2) <a href="https://twitter.com/justasisterfro2/status/1666867018023174145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>It is hard to decide what is most impressive, between this guy's impression of Michael Jackson and his actual boxing skill.

<p>Honestly, with a nickname like "The Spider," we should have all seen this coming. I used to mock people for not realizing Clark Kent and Superman are identical, but here I am in the same boat.</p><p>With that, we close the book on this week's Wild World of Fighting.

<p>While it is definitely not uncommon to see fighters not realize a ref is stopping a fight, continuing to grapple the referee when they are returning to consciousness, it is not often to see a fighter make their way back to their feet and still try to fight after being knocked out cold. Add that to the fact that the cage was filled with officials by that point, and it seems clear that Aiemann Zahabi likely gave Qileng Aori a pretty big concussion.</p><p>Stay tuned to MMA News for the latest news and updates from UFC 289.</p><ul><li><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/results/ufc-289-amanda-nunes-vs-irene-aldana-results-highlights">UFC 289: Amanda Nunes vs. Irene Aldana Results &amp; Highlights (7 PM ET)</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTc4MzA2MzE0OTM4Mjc5/aiemann-zahabi-qileng-aori.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Antônio 'Bigfoot' Silva Reacts After Suffering 11th Straight Defeat In Retirement Bout]]></title><description><![CDATA[António "Bigfoot" Silva fought for the 35th, and supposedly final, time in the headlining bout of the inaugural Kingdom Fighting event.

He then decided to return to the world of MMA for what he says would be his retirement fight, much to the relief of fans who felt he should have retired long ago.</p><p>That apparently final fight came at Kingdom Fighting 1, where he faced off against Salim El Ouassaidi. Although he managed to avoid getting finished, the former UFC fighter still lost a decision in this main event contest, with a clip of the fight being posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/Grabaka_Hitman/status/1667649357997301763?t=Pvm0YecM0NAI1i_gNCS2HQ&amp;s=19">Twitter </a>by Caposa.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Salim El Ouassaidi defeats Bigfoot Silva by decision in the Kingdom Fighting 1 main event.

Done 👍🏾💪🏾👊🏾" wrote Silva, before adding in Portuguese, "Thank God for everything, today say goodbye to MMA after 19 years in a very tough fight with the 25-year-old athlete, we got out in a beating for 3 rounds and in the end he took it by decision.

<h2>Conor McGregor Sent Burnie to the ER</h2><p>Some watching this moment during the Nuggets vs Heat game last night, may have noticed that it seemed like Conor McGregor punched the mascot a bit too hard for what was meant to be an advertisement for McGregor's pain relief spray. According to reports from <a href="https://theathletic.com/4599688/2023/06/10/conor-mcgregor-heat-mascot-nba-finals/">The Athletic,</a> that is exactly the case.</p><p>Apparently, McGregor was meant to hit Burnie enough to connect, simply so the Irishman could spray him with the pain relief spray. However, he hit the mascot so hard, that the person underneath the mask was sent to the ER, where he was treated after it was deemed medically necessary.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Conor McGregor is in Miami for game 4 🏀 <a href="https://t.co/16qypzDJRV">pic.twitter.com/16qypzDJRV</a></p>&mdash; Chamatkar Sandhu (@SandhuMMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/SandhuMMA/status/1667347428738056194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>It is unclear where this skit went wrong, whether it was the initial punch that sent Burnie to the ground, or the probably unnecessary follow-up shot to the grounded mascot. Either way, Conor McGregor did not seem to be too fazed or bothered, as he stayed and watched the entire game, which saw the Denver Nuggets score a big win in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, when the Miami Heat lost to them with a score of 108-95.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/conor-mcgregor-describes-fighter-brought-in-train-for-michael-chandler-fight">Conor McGregor Describes "Good, Solid Fighter" He Has Brought In Specifically To Train For Michael Chandler Bout</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTc0NzgyMjk0MjcxOTEx/conor-mcgregor-denver-nuggets-burnie.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA['This Is F'n Crazy' — Dwayne Johnson Offers Help To UFC Fighter With Only $7 In Bank Account Before A Fight]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dwayne Johnson has had a bit of a complicated relationship with UFC fans.

"I don't think she's gonna try to push the pace in the beginning because I'm even more powerful when I'm fresher.

She's gonna move, find her way, gonna switch stances... I even expect she'll try to clinch a bit and drain me a little bit," Nunes added.</p><p>The "Lioness" made Peña pay for her forward-pushing style at UFC 277.

</p><h2>Germaine de Randemie Fought For UFC Titles In Two Weight Classes&nbsp;</h2><p>De Randamie’s decision to return at age 39 following a lengthy layoff is somewhat surprising news, but she does hold wins over some of the UFC’s top-ranked female fighters, Also, her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/germaine-de-randamie-will-retire-if-she-loses-to-amanda-nunes-again">only losses</a> in the promotion came against two-division champion Amanda Nunes.</p><p>The Dutch fighter made her MMA debut in 2008 after a decorated career in kickboxing and Muay Thai. She joined the UFC in 2013 after the purchase of rival promotion Strikeforce.</p><p>De Randamie was stopped by Nunes in her second UFC bout, but after that finished two opponents to set up a fight for the UFC’s inaugural women’s featherweight belt against Holly Holm.

She went on to win 12 consecutive fights before eventually falling to&nbsp;Peña in their first matchup in December 2021.</p><p>The "Lioness," however, is no slouch on the feet, as she's demonstrated throughout her bantamweight title reigns.

<h2>Chris Curtis Looking To Rebound From Loss At UFC 289</h2><p>Both Curtis and the “Twitter troll” certainly appeared to have some fun with the interaction, so perhaps “The Action Man” is saving any frustration he may hold for when he takes on Nassourdine Imavov at this weekend’s UFC 289.</p><p>The two middleweights are set to compete in the night’s featured prelim, and both men are in need of a win to keep their place in the UFC rankings. Curtis currently sits at #14 after alternating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/chris-curtis-to-appeal-controversial-loss-after-kelvin-gastelum-climbs-the-rankings-following-ufc-287-barnburner">wins and losses</a> through his last few fights, while the #12 ranked Imavov had a three-fight win streak broken&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/strickland-imavov-results">earlier this year</a> when Curtis’ friend and teammate Sean Strickland defeated him via unanimous decision.</p><figure>

                    <p>That featured prelim promises to be arguably the most interesting fight of the UFC 289 undercard, but most fans will have their sights set on the action going down on the night’s main card.

</p><p>It’s no secret that the lighter weight classes in MMA tend to have deeper pools of talent, so major promotions are always on the lookout for prospects that are capable of making an impact in the heavier divisions. According to a post from&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mma_orbit/status/1667164352888143872?s=20">MMA Orbit</a>, manager Gor Azizyan has confirmed that Valter Walker has inked a deal with the sport’s leading organization.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨| Valter Walker (11-0), brother of Johnny Walker, has been signed by the UFC, per his manager Gor Azizyan.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MMA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MMA</a> <a href="https://t.co/VqGCGaoJeO">pic.twitter.com/VqGCGaoJeO</a></p>&mdash; MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) <a href="https://twitter.com/mma_orbit/status/1667164352888143872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h2>Valter Walker Brings Youth And Unbeaten Record To UFC's Heavyweight Division&nbsp;</h2><p>Having a talented brother already on the roster certainly doesn't hurt, but there’s a good chance that Valter’s impressive 11-0 record would have encouraged the UFC to come calling sooner rather than later.
</p><p>“The Clean Monster” finished his first three opponents in the first round before joining noted Russian regional promotion MMA Series, where he proceeded to go 6-0 with a brief stop in Arena Global along the way. After claiming the MMA Series heavyweight title in May, the 25-year-old made a quick turnaround to fight at the co-promoted Titan FC 82/Serbian Battle Championship 47 card earlier this month.

                    <p>Taking on UFC and PFL veteran Alex Nicholson, Valter slugged it out with “The Spartan” before getting a stoppage victory in the fourth round. The Brazilian captured the Titan FC heavyweight title in the process, and the result marked his seventh finish out of eleven pro fights.
</p><p>Valter will certainly have a tough act to follow when he joins the UFC, as Johnny is a fan-favorite that is currently in the best form of his career. The 31-year-old arrived in the promotion with a series of sensational finishes before suffering a run of tough results, but he’s now on a 3-fight win streak and is the UFC’s #5-ranked light heavyweight.

That run includes victories over Demian Maia, Stephen Thompson, and Vicente Luque.</p><p>But it's been Muhammad's most recent pair of outings that have seemingly helped cement himself a first opportunity at achieving championship status. After blemishing the record of Sean Brady last October, the 34-year-old Chicago-born fighter <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/features/4-positives-3-negatives-from-ufc-288-aljamain-sterling-vs-henry-cejudo">recorded his biggest win to date last month at UFC 288</a>, where he outpointed Gilbert Burns.</p><p>While the contest with "Durinho" boasted high stakes, Muhammad has long shared a good relationship with the Brazilian. The same certainly can't be said for the man from whom he'll be standing across inside the Octagon next...</p><h2>Muhammad 'Dislikes' Both Edwards &amp; Covington</h2><p>During a recent appearance on the <em>670 The Score</em> sports show, Muhammad was asked whether he has an opponent preference.</p><p>With reigning UFC Welterweight Champion Leon Edwards <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/colby-covington-key-preparation-breaking-leon-edwards-physically-mentally">expected to defend his title opposite Colby Covington next</a>, Muhammad appears to be waiting in the wings for a collision with the victor down the line.</p><p>Having had public back-and-forth with both fighters in recent times, Muhammad expressed excitement at the possibility of striking someone he "hates" for a change.</p><p>"I actually dislike both of them," Muhammad said. "So, for me, the last couple of guys I fought, I was actually friends with. Gilbert Burns I was actually cool with. We've trained together before and he's a very nice guy. So, the next guy will be somebody I actually dislike, so it'll be a fun buildup and it'll be a fun fight for me, to actually hit somebody that I hate."</p><p>Muhammad's animosity with the champ dates back to their headliner in March 2021. The bout ended in a disappointing fashion, with an inadvertent poke from Edwards resulting in damage to Muhammad's eye and a no contest.</p><p>Having accused "Rocky" of rejecting a rematch, "Remember the Name" wouldn't mind running it back with the Jamaican-born Brit with the gold on the line.</p><p>But should "Chaos" dethrone Edwards, Muhammad has also long shared his desire to be locked in the cage with the polarizing former interim titleholder. As well as Muhammad dismissing Covington's credentials, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/belal-muhammad-threatens-colby-covington-after-latest-racist-jibe-following-ufc-288-win">the pair have exchanged racism allegations in recent months</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s only one real number one contender <a href="https://t.co/KgxHzfYYyu">pic.twitter.com/KgxHzfYYyu</a></p>&mdash; Belal Muhammad (@bullyb170) <a href="https://twitter.com/bullyb170/status/1661386256041771025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote>

The relentless schedule of the MMA world means that some fans don’t have a full look at a fight card until days before the event, leaving the promoters to decide which bouts you should be paying the most attention to. 
</p><p>Everyone wants to tune in for main events and fights that feature popular names, but that means meaningful or potentially action-packed matchups from elsewhere on fight cards sometimes get lost in the shuffle. A Sleeper Scrap might highlight interesting style matchups, fighters with notable storylines, or bouts that simply have the chance to be a Fight of the Night contender.
</p><h2>The Fighters</h2><p>Mike Malott made his pro debut back in 2011, and after long periods of inactivity through his early career he’s now riding a five-fight streak of first-round finishes. 
</p><p>“Proper” ran through his first four opponents after turning pro and eventually joined the PFL, where he suffered his first career loss to current UFC featherweight Hakeem Dawodu.</p><p>Malott jumped over to Bellator the following year and fought to a majority draw with Thomas Diagne, and after securing another quick finish at XFFC 13, he had a nearly three-year layoff from competition.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The 31-year-old’s return at CFFC 91 saw him stop the previously undefeated Solomon Renfro, which led to a 39-second submission on <em>Dana White's Contender Series 2021</em> that Malott has now followed with a pair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ufc.com/athlete/mike-malott">first-round finishes</a> in the UFC.</p><p>Meanwhile, a brief three-fight amateur career saw Adam Fugitt finish all of his opponents via strikes, and he carried that streak into his 2016 pro debut when he finished Amin Kajtaz in the second round. 
</p><figure>
                        <img src="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTMyNDE0MzIwOTQ0NTc5/18787646.jpg" height="413" width="620">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Fugitt collected another win before dropping a decision to future UFC lightweight Austin Vanderford, and he then finished back-to-back opponents before being knocked out in the first round of his LFA debut. Three more finishes brought him back to the LFA in 2022, and after he scored his own victory over Renfro, he stepped up on short-notice to fight at UFC 277. 
</p><p>The 34-year-old gave the undefeated Michael Morales all he could handle before being knocked out in the third round, but Fugitt earned his first UFC victory when he stopped Yusaku Kinoshita with ground and pound earlier this year. 
</p><h2>The Matchup</h2><p>Although he’s most comfortable from orthodox stance, both of Malott’s fights in the UFC have seen the Canadian have success by starting his fights from southpaw.&nbsp;</p><p>“Proper” does a good job of doubling up on his jab to set up big power shots, with his overhand right and left hook being particularly dangerous. Malott also like to end his combinations with a leg kick or mix in some high kicks, and when pressured by opponents, he’s usually adapt at circling out of danger. 
</p><figure>
                        <img src="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTMyMjcxMjQ0ODQ2NTMx/18057442.jpg" height="413" width="620">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Fight fans saw the 31-year-old flash his power in his UFC debut against Mickey Gall, but Malott is arguably even more dangerous as a submission threat and is capable of finishing the fight after landing a takedown or as his opponents try to bring things to the mat.</p><p>Fugitt will hold a four-inch reach advantage over Malott, and although he’s not the cleanest striker he packs plenty of power and is more than capable of ending things on the feet.&nbsp;</p><figure>
                        <img src="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTMyMzc5OTYxMjA2Njk1/adam-fugitt-1jpg.jpg" height="356" width="620">

                    </figure>
                    <p>A southpaw, Fugitt relies a lot on his rear leg and will repeatedly throw high kicks if his opponents don’t make an effort to counter the attack. He also will time kicks to the open side of orthodox opponents, as well as repeatedly poke at their midsections with front kicks. The awkward angle that he throws some of his punches at can easily catch fighters off guard. 
</p><p>The 34-year-old makes good use of clinches and takedowns to halt pressure from his opponents, and he also excels at transitioning between takedown attempts in order to get things to the ground and land big strikes on the mat.
</p><h2>The Stakes</h2><p>The inclusion of this fight on the UFC 289 main card is somewhat surprising considering each man is still early in their tenure with the UFC, but Malott's last two wins may have the promotion hoping he can score another impressive finish in front of the Canadian crowd. 
</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The fact that all of Malott’s nine wins have come in the first round is an incredible statistic, and naturally it creates some question marks around how he might perform if Fugitt takes things beyond the opening five minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The 34-year-old already showed off some incredible durability in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ufc.com/athlete/adam-fugitt">UFC debut</a> against Morales, and he seems like exactly the type of fighter that could make things difficult for Malott if the Canadian is expecting a quick night of work.</p><figure>

                    <p>Even though neither man has a particularly extensive pro record, both welterweights are in their 30’s and likely know that a loss could put them just a fight or two away from exiting the UFC. There may be more pressure on Fugitt given that he’s 1-1 in the promotion, but a loss for Malott would also derail the momentum he’s established after starting his own UFC run in such impressive fashion.
</p><p>Malott is a massive threat to end things in the first round but Fugitt is also a dangerous finisher in his own right, and this bout certainly has all the potential to be one of the highlights of the night at UFC 289.

I wasn't home. Now I'm home," Moraes said. "I wish I had better performances here, but guys, I give all my heart. I train hard. I can look at myself in the mirror every day and be proud of myself, and I've been kickboxing, MMA since I was nine. I'm 35. That's 26 years that I gave all my life to this.</p><p>"I thank Anderson, my coach. I thank Ali&nbsp;Abdelaziz, my manager, I thank Ray Sefo for the opportunity, and I thank all the fans right here, and I wish PFL is going to be number one in the world and this guy that I just fought, I wish him the best," Moraes continued. "I wish everyone the best. He's a great fighter and man, I gave my heart to the sport, and thank you, god. God gave me all I have. I can't be sad today. I'm happy. Man, I have a beautiful wife and two kids. I'm a happy man."</p><p>Moraes ended his MMA career with a record of 23-13-1 and was a former WSOF bantamweight champion. He's had notable victories over Aljamain Sterling,&nbsp;José Aldo, and&nbsp;Raphael Assunção.

"Even with Ngannou, we were talking about getting together. You always see the MMA guys crossing over, but you never see the boxers crossing over, so I said I'm willing to make it more interesting for the fans and just the whole combat family as in a whole. I said why don't you come to my backyard, and after we handle business, I can come to yours and crossover and I really meant it. So things are still up in the air, but I have seen myself on this side of the field, you know. People will be very impressed on what I can do in my abilities to be here."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just spoke to Deontay Wilder here at PFL in Atlanta.

<p>Wilder also tried on the PFL gloves backstage, which he seemed to like. The promotion later had "The Bronze Bomber" back on the broadcast to speak with Couture and O'Connell, and the boxing superstar continued to tease a crossover fight with Ngannou.&nbsp;</p><p>"Aye Francis, if you listening, we discussed this before, and hey, we got many space and opportunity to discuss it once more," Wilder stated. " Aye, I'm looking for a two-fight crossing over. I'm willing to just go in the octagon as well as the original plans, but you know,&nbsp; the fans want to see it. I want to be a part of it.

"I'm just loving the whole process...I'm tough, I'm a tough 20-year-old girl. Not easy to beat.

"2021 champion, his history is crazy and everything he went through is similar to what I've gone through.

"Look, he’s got more wins than anyone else. But I love Jim Miller and that makes it hard for me – but I just don’t feel like time served puts you in the Hall of Fame...</p><p>"There’s an offensive lineman in the NFL right now that played 20 years. Is that guy going into the Hall of Fame just because he played 20 years? It doesn’t work that way, RC. You have to have accomplishments to go into the Hall of Fame.”</p><p>Cormier was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame last year alongside his longtime teammate Khabib Nurmagomedov. He retired following a trilogy loss to Stipe Miocic at UFC 252.</p><p>Cormier's comments come as Donald Cerrone is set to enter the UFC Hall of Fame this summer. Cerrone lost to Miller in his last fight at UFC 276 and will enter the UFC HOF despite never earning a belt in the promotion.</p><p>Time will tell if Miller will enter the UFC Hall of Fame, although Cormier thinks an induction for the veteran could create a poor precedent for the prestigious honor going forward.</p><ul><li><strong>Read Also: </strong><a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/irene-aldana-alexa-grasso-motivated-her-ahead-amanda-nunes-ufc-289">Irene Aldana Reveals How Teammate, New Champion Alexa Grasso Motivated Her Ahead Of Amanda Nunes Clash At UFC 289</a></li></ul><p><em>H/T&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2023/6/8/23754101/daniel-cormier-lobbying-keep-jim-miller-from-ufc-hall-of-fame-you-have-to-have-accomplishments-mma" rel="nofollow">MMA Mania</a>&nbsp;for the transcribed quotes</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTI2MTQ3Njk1NzQ4NTQ3/collage-maker-08-jun-2023-12-25-pm-5502.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jorge Masvidal Has A Surprising Prediction For Potential Israel Adesanya vs. Bo Nickal Fight]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since getting into MMA, UFC middleweight Bo Nickal has gained the attention of the fans and his peers.

                    <h2>Jorge Masvidal Praises Bo Nickal's Grappling</h2><p>Masvidal recently appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dSvetsbhJI&amp;t=2489s">BS with Jake Paul</a>&nbsp;and spoke&nbsp;highly of Nickal, explaining what it was like seeing the elite grappler train at American Top Team prior to his MMA transition. The former BMF champ noted that he has followed Nickal since he competed in wrestling for Penn State University.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gamebred" also hosted Nickal's debut MMA fight under his own promotional banner, Jorge Masvidal's iKon FC 3, last June. Nickal defeated John Noland by knockout in just 33 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>"I get to meet him at American Top Team, then we get to start training, and I was like, 'Man, this guy is just as good as I thought or better,'" Masvidal said of Nickal. "I can tell when someone is a good wrestler. I might not be the best wrestler, but I know like, what a good wrestler looks like. So I was like, 'This guy got legit talent to maybe take it overseas and compete for world championships and stuff,' and so when he did the hard left and went into fighting, I was like, this is going to be interesting, bro, to see what comes out of it, and he's killing it."</p><figure>

                    <p>On Nickal's wrestling ability, Masvidal explained that "The Allen Assassin" could dominate any opponent if he gets his hands on them.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm telling you right now, because I've seen him in the room, If he locks his hands on a lot of dudes, it's like, game over for that round," Masvidal stated. "He might just take a dude down and like, this guy is a nightmare, bro, to f*cking have on top of you."</p><h2>Jorge Masvidal Predicts Bo Nickal vs. Israel Adesanya</h2><p>Paul, a YouTuber-turned-boxer who has also trained with Nickal in recent months, later asked the former BMF champion if the relative newcomer could defeat current UFC Middleweight Champion Israel Adesanya.</p><p>Masvidal acknowledged that "The Last Stylebender" is talented, but he implied that Nickal could change the course of the potential fight in his favor with his grappling abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's young in his career right now, way young in his career right now," Masvidal explained. "But like I said, just right now, if he locks on a limb, good luck on Izzy getting away from him, though, and I've seen Izzy through his whole UFC career. Great athlete and good wrestling, but guys like Bo are just like, different.</p><p>"You can put him in the worst position, like, completely sprawled up, but his hands are like, locked, these guys find a way to just build back up, put you against the fence, and take you down and do it consecutively," Masvidal continued. "Once they lock, it's a different type of level, man. I don't think Izzy, no, I don't think, I know he's never competed against a wrestler that decorated, you know?"</p><p>Nickal's career is interesting as he has the support from his peers and fans who believe he can become a UFC champion. However, he must deal with the pressure of meeting people's expectations.</p><p>While Masvidal and Cejudo believe he could be a champion, we'll have to see how he does against Gore before fans can speculate about a fight against the likes of Adesanya.</p><ul><li><strong>Read Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/bo-nickal-confidence-branded-disrespectful-to-pioneers-of-the-sport-by-opponent">Bo Nickal's Confidence Branded "Disrespectful To Pioneers Of The Sport" By Next Opponent</a></li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dSvetsbhJI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTI3MzExODk5Nzk3NDE1/bo-nickal-and-adesanya.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk3NjM1NzkxMzExMDg3NDEw/aew-rampage-jorge-masvidal-3.jpg"><media:title>aew-rampage-jorge-masvidal-3</media:title><media:credit>Image&amp;colon; All Elite Wrestling</media:credit></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4MDM3NDg0MzAxNDYwNTkw/bo-nickal.jpg"><media:title>bo-nickal</media:title><media:credit>Photo Credit&amp;colon; Joseph Cress&amp;sol;Iowa City Press-Citizen via Imagn Content Services&amp;comma; LLC</media:credit></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Henry Cejudo Outlines One Area Where Charles Oliveira Is The Best In UFC History]]></title><description><![CDATA[Henry Cejudo believes that Charles Oliveira is the greatest submission specialist to ever step into the UFC’s Octagon.

</p><p>Oliveira is set to take on Beneil Dariush in the co-main event of UFC 289, and the lightweight matchup is the card’s most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/beneil-dariush-lays-out-perfect-gameplan-against-charles-oliveira-at-ufc-289">highly anticipated fight</a> in the eyes of many fans.</p><p>The pair were originally scheduled to meet at UFC 288 before “do Bronx” was forced to withdraw with an injury. The delay has seemingly only created more hype around the matchup.</p><p>Former two-division champion Cejudo has continued breaking down high-profile UFC bouts even now that he’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/henry-cejudo-takes-page-conor-mcgregor-book-comeback-declaration">returned to fighting</a>, and in his latest, “Triple C” insisted that Oliveira’s submission skills are unrivaled.</p><p>“He is super witty with his submissions,” Cejudo said on his&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/a_-CQXHaO-Y">YouTube channel</a>. “The best submission specialist that the UFC has ever offered. Even above Demian Maia. This guy is able to transition into a variety of different submissions and he’s good at everything. If there’s one area that I could say he’s 100% at – typically I don’t do this, because nobody’s one hundred – his submission game.”</p><h2>Henry Cejudo Praises "Extremely Dangerous" Charles Oliveira&nbsp;</h2><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Placing Oliveira’s submission skills above a legend like Maia is certainly lofty praise, and Cejudo believes the reason “do Bronx” is so dangerous is because he’s able to finish fights from any position.

                    <p>“He’s a threat everywhere. He’s a threat on the neck, on the heels, on the knees, on the arms. He’s got submissions coming from everywhere. It’s almost like when you train for a guy to fight like Charles ‘do Bronx’, you’re gonna have to be holding five aces because the dude is extremely dangerous.”
</p><p>As effective a finisher as Oliveira may be, there’s an argument to be made that Dariush is one of the only UFC lightweights capable of hanging with the Brazilian both on the feet and on the mat.</p><p>Currently sitting at #4 in the UFC’s lightweight rankings, the Iranian-born American is riding an eight-fight win streak and will be hoping that a win over Oliveira at UFC 289 will finally earn him a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/alexander-volkanovski-predicts-charles-oliveira-beneil-dariush-ufc-289">lightweight title shot</a>.</p><p>The UFC 289 co-main event between Oliveira and Dariush should no doubt thrill fans as part of the UFC’s return to Canada after four years away.

</p><p>Kara-France and Albazi met in the main event of last weekend’s UFC Fight Night event, and many fans were looking at the fight as a potential title eliminator for the flyweight division.</p><p>“Don’t Blink” entered the bout after losing an interim title fight to current UFC Flyweight Champion Brandon Moreno at UFC 277, but he ended up dropping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/kai-kara-france-reacts-loss-amir-albazi">back-to-back fights</a> for the first time in his promotional career when he lost a split decision.</p><p>The scoring of the fight faced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/features/4-positives-2-negatives-from-ufc-fight-night-kai-kara-france-vs-amir-albazi">immediate scrutiny</a> after the decision was read, and a recent episode of the&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/8imOYkDJQxk">MMArcade Podcast</a>&nbsp;included a suggestion from Whittaker that neither man had appeared particularly willing to push for a victory.</p><p>“It was for the number one contender spot, Kai getting another shot at that and Amir running for the belt,” Whittaker said. “So I feel like they should have been trying to push that pace a little bit. And you’ve gotta give it to Amir, he was pushing forward. Which I think is what led the judges to believe he was winning that fight, that swayed the judges in that direction.”
</p><h2>Whittaker Compares Kara-France's Approach To Adesanya's</h2><p>Kara-France soundly out-landed Albazi in terms of significant strikes, but Whittaker went on to say that his fellow Oceanic native was focusing too much on landing counter punches for large portions of the fight.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>“A big vibe I was getting across from Kai was just that he was really waiting for that counter, he was waiting for that moment where he can just step back, bang bang. Almost like his teammate Izzy Adesanya. He was kind of fighting like that, like very defensive counter striking. I think it works so well for Adesanya because of his body type and his body structure, I think he’s built for that style of fighting. But with Kai I feel like one of Kai’s strongest points is that he looks so dangerous moving forward. And you can see in the fight how fast Amir backed out of the positions when Kai was putting the foot down.” 
</p><p>“The Reaper” is certainly familiar with Adesanya’s style after sharing the cage with him on two occasions. They first met at UFC 243, where “The Last Stylebender” claimed Whittaker’s middleweight title with a second-round knockout. The two had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/robert-whittaker-israel-adesanya-ufc-287-inspired-me">competitive rematch</a> at UFC 271 before Adesanya briefly lost his title to Alex Pereira, but the 32-year-old avenged that loss earlier this year.</p><p>Whittaker has already rebounded from his second loss to Adesanya by winning a decision over Marvin Vettori, and many fans expect the winner of his upcoming UFC 290 bout with Dricus Du Plessis to be the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/robert-whittaker-praise-dricus-du-plessis-honorable-spirit-ahead-of-title-eliminator">next challenger</a>&nbsp;at 185 pounds.</p><ul><li><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/ariel-helwani-puts-abc-president-on-blast-after-defending-mma-judging">Ariel Helwani Puts ABC President On Blast After On-Air Text Defending 'Broken' MMA Judging</a></li></ul><p><em>Please provide transcription credit with a link to this article if you use any of these quotes.

However, that was the last win of his career, and he subsequently fell to a four-fight losing streak.

                    <h2>Jorge Masvidal Shows Interest In Boxing, But Needs UFC Permission</h2><p>Masvidal recently sat down for an interview on YouTuber-turned-boxer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dSvetsbhJI&amp;t=2196s">Jake Paul's show</a>. He was asked whether he would compete in boxing, and whole Masvidal admitted interest in the venture, he noted one sizable hurdle.&nbsp;</p><p>"Definitely, I would box. That is something that I wanted to do, especially since I started progressing more in my skillset and I have a pro boxing fight," Masvidal said. "It took place like 14, 15 years ago. Boxing was like, my first love, so I would definitely do a boxing match if the UFC permits me. They would have to give me permission. They'd have to be like, 'Yeah, go do your thing, you know.' If not, can't do no boxing match."</p><p>UFC fans may see Masvidal's problem as similar to former UFC welterweight and middleweight champion George St-Pierre.</p><p><a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/a-disappointed-st-pierre-says-dana-white-blocked-de-la-hoya-fight">The UFC blocked St-Pierre from competing against Oscar&nbsp;De La Hoya</a> in 2021 because the Canadian was still under contract with the promotion. That was despite the fact that he was retired.</p><p>Masvidal is now seemingly facing the same problem, and won't be able to compete in boxing or MMA in a different company without permission from the UFC or a release from his contract with the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>While Masvidal can't compete in pugilism, he has become a promoter for his own boxing company.

<h2>Font &amp; Song In Pursuit Of Consecutive Victories</h2><p>If everything goes according to plan, and Font and Song do collide this summer, both men will be looking to secure second straight victories.</p><p>Font (20-6) returned to the winner's circle <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/features/7-positives-2-negatives-from-ufc-287-pereira-vs-adesanya-2">this past April at UFC 287</a>. After suffering back-to-back decision losses to&nbsp;José Aldo and Marlon Vera, the New England Cartel standout bounced back in style by knocking out Adrian Yanez in Miami.</p><p>He'll now pursue an entry into the bantamweight title picture by potentially stalling the rise of a contender 10 years his junior.</p><p>The 25-year-old Song (20-7-1, 1 NC) has long been touted as a future championship challenger at 135 pounds after debuting in the Octagon aged just 20. While he recorded impressive victories over Vera, Casey Kenney, and Marlon Moraes to climb the ladder, a headline loss to Cory Sandhagen paused his surge last September.</p><p>But having rebounded in <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/features/5-positives-2-negatives-from-ufc-fight-night-song-yadong-vs-ricky-simón">the UFC Vegas 72 main event in April</a>, where he stopped&nbsp;Ricky Simón via TKO early into the fifth round, the Chinese star could have the chance to resume his ascent against Font.</p><p>Should this expected addition come to fruition, the current fights expected to take place at UFC 292 on August 19 are as follows:</p><ul><li><em>Aljamain Sterling (c) vs. Sean O'Malley (bantamweight championship main event)</em></li><li><em>Zhang Weili (c) vs. Amanda Lemos (strawweight championship co-main event)</em></li><li><em>Chris Weidman vs. Brad Tavares (middleweight)</em></li><li><em>Rob Font vs. Song Yadong (bantamweight)</em></li><li><em>Cody Garbrandt vs. Mario Bautista (bantamweight)</em></li><li><em>Gregory Rodrigues vs. Denis Tiuluilin (middleweight)</em></li><li><em>Gerald Meerschaert vs. Andre Petroski (middleweight)</em></li></ul><figure>

Now, she's just days out from a date in the cage with one of, if not the, greatest female fighters of all time.</p><p>The switch came as a result of Julianna Peña's forced withdrawal from the main event of the UFC 289 pay-per-view, set for this Saturday, June 10, at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>After being drafted in to fill the void against Amanda Nunes, Aldana is pursuing what would no doubt go down as one of the biggest upsets in recent memory. Per <a href="https://www.betonline.ag/sportsbook/martial-arts/mma/ufc-289" rel="nofollow">BetOnline.ag</a>, the reigning two-division champion currently sits as a -345 favorite to retain her 135-pound belt.</p><p>But when it comes to shocking the masses and upsetting the odds come fight night, Aldana isn't without useful insight.</p><h2>Aldana Takes Inspiration From Champ Teammate Grasso</h2><p>This past March, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/watch-alexa-grasso-practiced-key-sequence-leading-up-to-ufc-285-win">Alexa Grasso secured flyweight glory by submitting previously long-reigning queen Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 285</a>. The Mexican trains alongside Aldana in Guadalajara.</p><p>Having witnessed her teammate join 125-pound kingpin Brandon Moreno and interim featherweight champ Yair Rodríguez as her nation's third active titleholder, "Robles" has been inspired to add to Mexico's 2023 success inside the Octagon.</p><p>"(Grasso's title win was) very inspiring. It's a great motivation for me, seeing her accomplish that," Aldana said. "And not just accomplishing it, but the way she accomplished that. She shined that night. She won (against) one of the greatest of all time. Valentina Shevchenko is not an easy fight, we all know that. How she did that and how she managed all this, it was awesome.</p><p>"When she got to Guadalajara after her fight with Valentina, she went to my home and showed me her belt. The first thing she said was, 'You're next,'" Aldana recalled. "I was like, 'No, this is your time! Congratulations!' (She said), 'You're next.' It was great to see her like that and we have been looking back all this time. It has been a long journey and it is nice that we have shared this together, we have lived this together almost, at the same time."</p><p>Aldana will now look to channel her teammate's recent ability to overcome a sizable hurdle and repeat the feat herself <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/irene-aldana-cites-amanda-nunes-goat-status-motivation-ufc-289">at the expense of the consensus GOAT, Nunes</a>.</p><p>If she does so this weekend on Canadian soil, it stands to reason that she'll be quickly home to Mexico to celebrate with the flyweight queen as the newly crowned bantamweight champ.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A face off with a view 😍<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> Fight Week in Vancouver starting strong! <a href="https://t.co/5OxVYxHSX2">pic.twitter.com/5OxVYxHSX2</a></p>&mdash; UFC (@ufc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1666523818129780737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2023</a></blockquote>

With many who believe Kara-France deserved the nod acknowledging that D'Amato's verdict may be justifiable, the main point of criticism has been directed at the doorstep of Lee.</p><p>The often-discussed cageside scorer arrived at his final tally thanks to a widely debated decision to back Albazi's efforts in round four. On <a href="http://mmadecisions.com/decision/14045/Amir-Albazi-vs-Kai-Kara-France" rel="nofollow">MMA Decisions</a>, just 3.2 percent of 774 fan scorecards submitted as of this writing saw the frame the same way as Lee.</p><p>With that questionable scorecard ultimately handing Albazi a four-place rank rise, a potential title shot, and his win money, many prominent names in the community have called for change given what Kara-France was left missing out on — although much of the criticism for the New Zealander's paycheck has also centered around the UFC's decision to employ a show/win remuneration structure.</p><p>One such vocal figure is Helwani, who recently laid into the mindset of the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC).</p><h2>Helwani Slams ABC Chief For Judging 'Secrecy'</h2><p>During a recent episode of <em>The MMA Hour</em>, Helwani laid into ABC President Mike Mazzulli after receiving an on-air text about his remarks regarding <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/ariel-helwani-brands-paddy-pimblett-win-one-of-the-worst-decisions-ever">the judging debate</a>.</p><p>The ABC is a&nbsp;professional boxing and MMA organization that puts together contests and resides over record-keeping, and is governed by delegates of various forms of athletic commissions in the United States and Canada. Among its duties, the ABC approves the scoring criteria by which fights are judged.</p><p>Upon hearing Helwani's take on the recent controversy, the ABC's Mazzulli encouraged the reporter to attend the organization's scoring course — which is free to attend for fighters and media members — to better understand what the judges are observing.</p><p>While the likes of TSN's Aaron Bronsteter and the New York Post's Scott Fontana have credited the course for forming an improved knowledge of the criteria, Helwani insisted that Mazzulli's focus on non-judges improving their understanding deflects from the real issue.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. We in MMA media should be pressing regulations to a allow them to let officials speak without fear of commission reprisal — which is very real.<br><br>2. All MMA media members should attend the ABC classes to learn about officiating.

<p>For Helwani, that's a lack of transparency, explanation, and accountability.</p><p>"Just got a text message from Mike Mazzulli of the ABC," Helwani said. "(He wrote), 'I heard some of your podcast. I know you want to understand the scoring criteria and what the judges are looking at. Come to Vegas and attend the class. It is free to all fighters and press. Please state that on your next podcast.' I feel like 'please state that on your next podcast' is a very interesting way. I am stating it right now.</p><p>"Again, I will reiterate what I think both he and other people in these commission circles are missing, is the fact I know what it is... What I wanna know is what this guy is thinking on Saturday night when the rest of the world sees one thing and there's like five people on the planet that see another. That's what I want," Helwani continued. "I want to talk to the people. What they're trying to spin here is — I don't wanna be a judge... I want to talk to the judges, I want to talk to the commission."</p><p>The Canadian journalist went on to call out Mazzulli and his organization for imposing a needless and damaging aura of "secrecy" around the judges, who at the moment aren't required to publicly explain their scorecards.</p><p>"Mazzulli likes to say, 'I need to protect the judges.' Why? That is their job. Again, I'm stating this as you want," Helwani exclaimed. "This secrecy around the judges like they work for the FBI, like, you signed up to this. And spare me the talk (that) they don't make enough, that's on you guys! You can pay them more if you want.</p><p>"Guess what? You're affecting people's pay. Kai Kara-France has $100,000 (less) in his bank account because of that fourth round," Helwani added. "So, 'Please state that on your podcast,' alright, I'll state that... Now please let me know why we can't talk to any of these judges and why you keep having Doug Crosby work your events. Can we state that on the podcast too? Come on, man."</p><p>Helwani went on to tie the discussion back to <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/kayla-harrison-endorses-open-scoring-after-stunning-pfl-loss">his and others' call for open scoring to be implemented</a>.</p><p>He pointed to the ABC's refusal to engage in discourse with the fighters about the transparent method as another example of the athletes not getting a say in their careers.</p><p>"Why can't the fighters have a say? Why can't there be, at the ABC commission, a representative for the fighters who shows up and says, 'I want open scoring.' ... Why is it the same guys sitting around deciding the fate of these fighters and what's in their bank account? I'm so tired of this shit. I'm so tired of the old way of them doing it.</p><p>"Please tell me why your model is broken... When 98 percent of the fighters, and the audience, and the broadcasters, and everyone at home has no idea what you're looking at, that means it's broken... No one understands what the f*ck you're looking at... Do a better job of explaining it to the audience... All this is so wack."</p><p>The longtime combat sports reporter <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/brendan-schaub-fighters-boycott-ufc-300-pressure-dana-white-reform-judging">certainly isn't short on supporters when it comes to his desire for accountability</a>, with a&nbsp;host of fighters and pundits also calling for judges to explain how they reach their verdicts.</p><p>That recently included UFC Middleweight Champion Israel Adesanya, who berated the scoring of his teammate Kara-France's setback against Albazi last Saturday.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Start interviewing the judges after fights.<br>Hold them accountable for their work.</p>&mdash; Israel Adesanya (@stylebender) <a href="https://twitter.com/stylebender/status/1665216420672679936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2023</a></blockquote>

                    <h2>Oleksandr Usyk's Co-Promoter Reveals Tyson Fury Will Be Getting Final Offer From Saudia Arabia</h2><p>Usyk's co-promoter&nbsp;Alex Krassyuk spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG1BScpCtPM&amp;t=10s">iFL TV's Umar</a> on June 6 about the progress of getting a fight agreement with Usyk and Fury. He shared that the Ukrainian has been willing to fight his British counterpart, even when the contract terms weren't in his favor. However, he suggested that Fury is unwilling to compete despite his remarks on social media.</p><p>Fury's promoter Frank Warren has insisted that Saudia Arabia is yet to send a written offer for "The Gypsy King" to fight Usyk. Now, Krassyuk has revealed that he expects Fury to get a final offer soon.&nbsp;</p><p>"According to my knowledge, they will receive a formal written offer very soon, and it will be their decision or Tyson's decision whether to take it or leave it because we have done everything possible to make this fight happen, and now the ball is on Tyson's side," Krassyuk said. "It's an offer to take it or leave it. If you take it, then you have a big fight. The Biggest fight of your career.</p><p>"If you hesitate or if you try to trade out something or trying to swing around, it shows that you are not serious and you have to relinquish the belt and retire. Not for one month or for one week, as you use to retire shortly, recently, but probably forever," Krassyuk concluded.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how Fury will react to the potential ultimatum from Saudia Arabia. "The Gypsy King" seems to like being in control of negotiations, so boxing fans will have to wait and see if they can get the Brit to come to terms for a the long-awaited dream fight against Usyk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Read Also:</strong><a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/michael-bisping-claims-tyson-fury-vs-jon-jones-would-do-6-7-million-ppv-buys">&nbsp;Michael Bisping Says Tyson Fury vs. Jon Jones Would Do As Many PPV Buys As Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor</a></li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JG1BScpCtPM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTE4NDExNjUzODE3Nzk1/befunky-64.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.mmanews.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4NTA0MzQ0MDI1MzEwNjU5/tyson-fury.jpg"><media:title>tyson-fury</media:title><media:credit>Photo Credit&amp;colon; Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports</media:credit></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Charles Oliveira Reacts To Talk Of BMF Champion Leapfrogging Him For LW Title Shot]]></title><description><![CDATA[After failing to regain the 155-pound crown last October in Abu Dhabi, former UFC lightweight champion Charles Oliveira will shoot for a chance at redemption this weekend.

Following an eight-fight winning run, many believe the Iranian-born American has already done enough to earn a first title shot.</p><p>Nevertheless, he'll have one more challenge to pass before a likely showdown with reigning champion Islam Makhachev, and it'll be no easy task.</p><p>Despite falling short against Makhachev at UFC 280, Oliveira appears motivated to avenge the loss soon enough. In fact, despite the views of some, the Brazilian has insisted a rematch is on the cards for later this year.</p><h2>Oliveira: Poirier vs. Gaethje Winner Won't Be Above Me</h2><p>Ahead of Saturday's event in British Columbia, some have branded the co-main event a one-sided title eliminator. That includes Makhachev's American Kickboxing Academy coach Javier Mendez, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/islam-makhachev-coach-assesses-title-implications-charles-oliveira-beneil-dariush">who appears skeptical that a victory over Dariush will be enough for Oliveira to fight for the championship again</a>.</p><p>With that, Mendez suggested that the UFC will likely turn to the upcoming BMF title fight between Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje in Salt Lake City on July 29 to select his pupil's next challenger.</p><p>But during his appearance at UFC 289 media day on Wednesday, Oliveira firmly dismissed the notion that the next BMF champ will be ahead of him in the pecking order should he stall Dariush's charge in Canada.</p><p>"Surely (it's me). Whoever wins this fight, this Saturday, is gonna go for the title," Oliveira said. "I'm next, I'm in line for it."</p><p>"Do Bronx" will no doubt look to boost his chances of a rematch with the Dagestani titleholder by putting on an emphatic performance come fight night this Saturday.</p><p>While the Brazilian was self-admittedly a shell of his usual self on Yas Island last October, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/charles-oliveira-outlines-what-make-difference-beneil-dariush-fight-ufc-289">he's promised a reinvigorated iteration of Charles Oliveira at UFC 289</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Charles Oliveira can do it ALL 💪<a href="https://twitter.com/CharlesDoBronxs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CharlesDoBronxs</a> is back and ready for action at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a> Saturday! <a href="https://t.co/92nTVqRT8a">pic.twitter.com/92nTVqRT8a</a></p>&mdash; UFC (@ufc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1666610997522726912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2023</a></blockquote>

"You can do what the SAG writers and just protest...what you do is rally the troops, do it before the big event, UFC 300, the week of...'Guess what? Unless there's a change, we aren't fighting. '... If the fighters decided to put their foot in the ground, two days and things would change."</p><p>As of this writing, the UFC doesn't have an athlete-led union, although that could change amidst the ongoing fighter pay debate and other hot topics in the sport.</p><p>Open scoring is another solution that has been presented by some to combat head-scratching scorecards. Judges currently aren't required to reveal their perspective as to why they score specific fights the way they do.</p><p>UFC 300 will take place next year and will likely be a massive event in the promotion's history.

The pay-per-view event will take place at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada, this Saturday.</p><p>Ahead of the contest, many have expressed high expectations. Given both men's entertaining history and penchant for striking firefights, some are predicting that the pair will leave British Columbia with Fight of the Night honors.</p><p>Should that be the case, "50K" is expecting to return home with both another bonus check and a victory added to his record. In the buildup, Ige has claimed he can "make it look easy" against Landwehr.</p><p>The top 15 featherweight has even sought to use his opponent's nickname against him, <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/dan-ige-make-it-look-easy-against-nate-landwehr-ufc-289">insisting that he will control and derail "The Train" come fight night on June 10</a>.</p><p>Evidently, Ige has a tough crowd when it comes to Landwehr...</p><h2>Landwehr Grades Ige's Trash Talk: 'That's The Oldest One'</h2><p>During his appearance at UFC 289 media day on Wednesday, Landwehr reacted to Ige's pre-fight remarks, branding his play on words unoriginal and "wack."</p><p>"The Train" went on to note that while Ige enters the event as a favorite who will be defending his place on the ladder from below, he'll be locked in the cage with a "monster" in Vancouver.</p><p>"You know, when I see stuff like that (Ige's trash talk), I'm like, man, at least have an original idea. I've never heard that one. I've never head, 'I wanna derail the train,'" Landwehr said sarcastically. "That's the oldest one. I've heard that probably like — come up with something! It's kind of like, that's wack.&nbsp;</p><p>"I get it. You can't think of nothing else cool to say. You might as well go to that," Landwehr continued. "Every day when I was going to sleep for this fight camp, I knew I was fighting one of the best in the world. But every day, he goes to sleep knowing he's fighting a f**king monster."</p><p>To earn a shot at the featherweight rankings, Landwehr has won three straight since a TKO loss to Julian Erosa back in 2021.</p><p>After submitting&nbsp;Ľudovít Klein and <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/fighters-react-to-onama-and-landwehrs-foty-contender">outpointing David Onama in a memorable Fight of the Night scrap at UFC San Diego</a>, "The Train" made it a hat-trick of bonuses this past March at UFC San Antonio, where he forced Austin Lingo to tap.</p><p>The former M-1 Global champion will now look to continue that run of form in what will no doubt mark the stiffest test of his Octagon career to date.</p><figure>
